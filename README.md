## 📚 My Learning Journey, a repository
This repository is not just code — it’s a record of my growth, experiments, mistakes, and discoveries as I learn and improve as a developer.
Every commit here tells something: a problem I tried to solve, a concept I explored, a mistake I made, or a new tool I tried for the first time.

## 🌱 Philosophy
I believe learning to code isn’t just about reaching an end goal — it’s about **documenting the journey**.
This repository is my way of:

- Keeping track of what I’ve learned
- Seeing my progress over time
- Embracing mistakes as stepping stones
- Staying consistent and curious

I treat this repo as:

- A personal classroom — where I’m both the teacher and the student
- A lab — where experiments can fail or succeed without fear
- A time capsule — where future-me can look back and smile at past-me’s code

## 🛠 What’s Inside
Here you’ll find:

- Small projects & practice exercises
- Experiments with new programming concepts
- Notes, snippets, and mini-documentations
- Occasional “aha!” moments captured in code or commit message

The contents might be messy at times — and that’s intentional (not really). Growth isn’t linear, and this repo reflects that.

## 🚀 How I am using this repository
- **Learn something new** from tutorials (mainly the odin project), books, experiments
- **Apply it in code** no matter how small the project
- **Commit the work** along with a note on what I learned or struggled with
- **Reflect** from time to time on past commits or struggles on projects

## 🗓 Timeline of Learning
- **Aug. 10, 2025**: Initial commit, trying to figure out git, and some HTML & CSS basic courses
    - **same day**: completing the first assignement in the form of a basic cookbook
    - **same day**: figured I should use some form of boilerplate on my projects, so I added a folder which would contain that
