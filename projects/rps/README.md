## ðŸª¨ðŸ“„âœ‚ Rock Paper Scissors

A simple Rock Paper Scissors game built as a small coding exercise.  
I made this in about 3 hours as part of the learning journey â€” focusing on practicing basic JavaScript logic and user interaction through the console.  

### ðŸŽ¯ Features
- Play against the computer in a classic best-of format  
- Randomized computer choices for fair gameplay  
- Instant feedback in the console on each roundâ€™s result  

### ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for styling
- **JavaScript** (logic and console interaction)  

### ðŸ“š What I Learned
- Handling user input in JavaScript  
- Using conditionals to determine game outcomes  
- Generating random results with `Math.random()`  

### âœ… TODO
- Create a simple UI for browser play (kinda âœ…)
- Add DOM updates to display game results visually (kinda âœ…)
- Improve game flow with a score tracker in the UI (kinda âœ…)
