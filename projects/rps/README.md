## ðŸª¨ðŸ“„âœ‚ Rock Paper Scissors

A simple Rock Paper Scissors game built as a small coding exercise.  
I made this in about 3 hours for the first console assignment, +3 hours for refactoring and adding the DOM manipulation, as part of the learning journey â€” focusing on practicing basic JavaScript logic and user interaction through the console.  

### ðŸŽ¯ Features
- Play against the computer in a classic best-of format  
- Randomized computer choices for fair gameplay  
- Instant feedback in the DOM on each roundâ€™s result  

### ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for styling
- **JavaScript** (logic and DOM interaction)  

### ðŸ“š What I Learned
- Handling user input in JavaScript  
- Using conditionals to determine game outcomes  
- Generating random results with `Math.random()`  
- Events handling
- DOM manipulation

### âœ… TODO
- Improve player feedback on click
- maybe someday implement a Best Of 5 ruleset (never happening as I am moving on from this project)

### Notes:
I would like to learn a bit more on decoupling the logic from the DOM manipulation side of things. As of right now I believe the code is just a mess. TBC !
