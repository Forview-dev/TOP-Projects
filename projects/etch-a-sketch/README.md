## ðŸŽ¨ðŸ•¹ Etch-a-Sketch

A fun little Etch-a-Sketchâ€“style mini game built as a coding exercise.  
It took me about **an hour** to complete, and it was a great way to practice handling events and drawing on the screen with JavaScript.  

### ðŸŽ¯ Features
- Move the "pen" using the mouse  
- Draw on cells across the canvas  
- Classic Etch-a-Sketchâ€“inspired gameplay

### ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **HTML** for the canvas  
- **CSS** for layout and styling  
- **JavaScript** for drawing logic and controls  

### ðŸ“š What I Learned
- Capturing and handling events 
- Better DOM manipulation

### âœ… TODO
- Add color options for drawing  
- Implement a "shake" effect to clear the screen  
- Add the ability to save drawings as images
